- Performs basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (−)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
  - Modulus (%)
  - Decimal (.)
- Clear (`C`) and evaluate (`=`) buttons
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## 🧠 How It Works

The calculator uses a global `equation` string to store and update the mathematical expression as the user clicks the buttons. When the user clicks `=`, the expression is evaluated using Python's `eval()` function.
